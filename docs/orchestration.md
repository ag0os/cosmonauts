# Orchestration

Cosmonauts coordinates agents across a spectrum: from a single agent answering directly, to fully automated chain runs, to always-on agents pairing with humans. Drive and chains will merge into a unified surface; for now they're complementary.

## Chain Runner

Runs agent pipelines using Pi sessions. The DSL is pure topology — it declares which roles run in what order. Loop behavior is intrinsic to each role (coordinator loops until all tasks are Done; others run once).

```
cosmonauts --chain "planner -> task-manager -> coordinator -> integration-verifier -> quality-manager" "design and implement auth"
```

### Bracket groups (parallel at the same stage)

Two or more roles run concurrently:

```
cosmonauts --chain "planner -> [task-manager, reviewer] -> coordinator" "design with parallel review"
```

### Fan-out (N copies of a role)

Spawns N instances of the same role in parallel:

```
cosmonauts --chain "coordinator -> reviewer[3]" "review with multiple reviewers"
```

> **Fan-out note:** `reviewer[3]` sends the **same prompt** to all three instances — it does not shard tasks or assign different work to each instance.

### Safety caps

`maxTotalIterations` (default 50) and `timeoutMs` (default 30 min) are global, not per-stage.

## Named Workflows

The primary user interface for multi-agent pipelines. Built-in defaults live in `bundled/coding/coding/workflows.ts` (mirrored in `lib/config/defaults.ts`) and can be overridden or extended via `.cosmonauts/config.json`.

| Name | Chain | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| `plan-and-build` | `planner → plan-reviewer → planner → task-manager → coordinator → integration-verifier → quality-manager` | Full pipeline with adversarial plan review |
| `implement` | `task-manager → coordinator → integration-verifier → quality-manager` | From an existing approved plan |
| `verify` | `quality-manager` | Review + remediation on existing changes |
| `spec-and-build` | `spec-writer → planner → plan-reviewer → planner → task-manager → coordinator → integration-verifier → quality-manager` | Interactive spec capture then reviewed build |
| `adapt` | `planner → task-manager → coordinator → integration-verifier → quality-manager` | Planner studies a reference codebase path and adapts patterns |

Test-first is the `planner`'s baseline: every plan it produces is behavior-driven and implemented test-first, so `plan-and-build` and `spec-and-build` cover what used to be a separate TDD workflow. Adaptation is likewise a `planner` mode — point it at a reference codebase path and the `adapt` workflow handles it.

Every design-driven default includes `plan-reviewer` as a mandatory adversarial step before task creation. For code-time review, `quality-manager` internally triages which specialist lenses (security, performance, UX) apply to the diff and spawns the applicable ones in parallel alongside the generalist `reviewer`.

Run `cosmonauts --list-workflows` for the live list, including any project-level overrides.

## Drive

`cosmonauts drive` is the CLI verb for driver runs: inline mode runs inside the host assistant session, while detached mode writes a frozen run directory and continues independently. The driver tools (`run_driver`, `watch_events`) are exposed via the `drive` capability — currently only loaded by `main/cosmo`.

> Drive and chains will eventually merge into one orchestration surface. Until then, prefer drive for plan-linked task runs and chains for ad-hoc pipelines.

## CLI Surface

```
cosmonauts                                   # Interactive REPL with main/cosmo
cosmonauts -d coding                          # Interactive REPL with coding/cody
cosmonauts "design an auth system"           # Initial prompt to main/cosmo
cosmonauts -d coding "implement this task"    # Initial prompt to coding/cody
cosmonauts --print "create tasks and go"     # Non-interactive (fire-and-forget)
cosmonauts --workflow plan-and-build "auth"   # Named workflow
cosmonauts --chain "planner -> coordinator"  # Raw chain DSL
cosmonauts drive                              # Driver task runs
```

Key flags:

- `-a, --agent <id>` — choose agent (use `--list-agents` to see available)
- `-d, --domain <id>` — set domain context for unqualified IDs
- `--workflow <name|expression>` — named workflow or raw chain
- `--chain <expression>` — raw chain DSL
- `--print` — non-interactive mode
- `--model <provider/model-id>` — override default model
- `--thinking [level]` — set thinking level
- `--list-domains`, `--list-workflows`, `--list-agents`
- `--dump-prompt -a <id>` — print the composed system prompt for an agent

Run `cosmonauts --help` for the full list.

## Tools the agents use

Two key orchestration tools live in the `spawning` capability (`domains/shared/capabilities/spawning.md`), available to any agent that lists it:

- **`spawn_agent`** — non-blocking; returns a spawn ID immediately, child runs detached, completion arrives as a follow-up turn.
- **`chain_run`** — runs a chain expression as a single tool call.

See `domains/shared/capabilities/spawning.md` for usage patterns and the parallel-spawning protocol.
