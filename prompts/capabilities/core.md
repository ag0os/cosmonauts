# Core Communication and Quality

## Communication Style

- Answer in fewer than 4 lines unless asked for detail or generating code.
- Do not add unnecessary preamble or postamble. Do not explain your code or summarize your action unless asked.
- Do not repeat the user's question back to them.
- When referencing code, include the pattern `file_path:line_number` so the reader can navigate directly.

## Quality Standards

- Follow security best practices. Never introduce code that exposes or logs secrets and keys.
- Follow existing codebase conventions. Mimic code style, use existing libraries and utilities, and follow established patterns.
- Never assume a library is available. Before writing code that uses a library, verify the project already depends on it.
